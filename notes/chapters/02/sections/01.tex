A \textbf{mathematical system} consists of \textbf{axioms}, which are assumed to be true and \textbf{definitions}, which are used to create new concepts in terms of existing ones.  Within a mathematical system, we can derive a \textbf{theorem}, which is a proposition that has been proved to be true.\\

There are two special types of theorems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{lemma:} not interesting in its own right, but useful for proving other theorems.
    \item \textbf{corollary:} follows easily from another theorem.
\end{itemize}

A \textbf{proof} is an argument that establishes the truth of a theorem.  Logic is used to analyze proofs.

\subsubsection*{Example 1}

One example of a mathematical system is Euclidean geometry.  This mathematical system contains the following theorem and corollary:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{theorem:} If two sides of a triangle are equal, then the angles opposite them are equal.
    \item \textbf{corollary:} If a triangle is equilateral, then it is equiangular.
\end{itemize}

The corollary follows immediately from the theorem.

\subsection*{Direct Proofs}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Direct Proofs}

Theorems are often of the from
\begin{center}
    For all $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, if $p(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$, then $q(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$.
\end{center}

The above is true provided that the conditional proposition $p \rightarrow q$ is true for all $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ in the domain.  A \textbf{direct proof} assumes that $p(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ is true and then, using $p(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ as well as other axioms, definitions, previously derived theorems, and rules of inference, shows directly that $q(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ is true.\\

For example, to use the terms ``even integer'' and ``odd integer'' in a proof, we must first define them.
\begin{center}
    An integer $n$ is \textit{even} if there exists an integer \textit{k} such that $n = 2k$.\\
    An integer $n$ is \textit{odd} if there exists an integer \textit{k} such that $n = 2k + 1$.
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Example 2}

Give a direct proof of the following statement:
\begin{center}
    For all integers \textit{m} and \textit{n}, if \textit{m} is odd and \textit{n} is even, then $m + n$ is odd.
\end{center}

We begin by first writing out the hypothesis and conclusion:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
\textit{m} is odd and \textit{n} is even. (Hypothesis)\\
$\dots$\\
$m + n$ is odd. (Conclusion)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We begin to fill in the gaps using the definitions of even and odd:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
\textit{m} is odd and \textit{n} is even. (Hypothesis)\\
\textit{m} = $2k_1 + 1$ ($k_1$ is an integer)\\
\textit{n} = $2k_2$ ($k_2$ is an integer)\\
$\dots$\\
$m + n$ is odd. (Conclusion)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Finally, to derive our conclusion, we use the definition of odd once again:
\begin{align*}
    m + n &= (2k_1 + 1) + 2k_2\\
    &= 2(k_1 + k_2) + 1
\end{align*}

Our final proof:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
\textit{m} is odd and \textit{n} is even. (Hypothesis)\\
\textit{m} = $2k_1 + 1$ ($k_1$ is an integer)\\
\textit{n} = $2k_2$ ($k_2$ is an integer)\\
$m + n = 2(k_1 + k_2) + 1$\\
$m + n$ is odd. (Conclusion)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Example 3}

Give a direct proof of the following statement:
\begin{center}
    For all sets $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, $X \intersection (Y - Z) = (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$
\end{center}

We begin by first writing out the hypothesis and conclusion:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
$X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are sets. (Hypothesis)\\
$\dots$\\
$X \intersection (Y - Z) = (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$ (Conclusion)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We are trying to conclude that sets $X \intersection (Y - Z)$ and $(X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$ are equal.  Recall the definition of set equality:
\begin{center}
    For every \textit{x}, if $x \in X$, then $x \in Y$\\
    For every \textit{x}, if $x \in Y$, then $x \in X$
\end{center}

We begin to fill in the gaps using the definition of set equality:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
$X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are sets. (Hypothesis)\\
If $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$, then $x \in (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$\\
If $x \in (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$, then $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$\\
$\dots$\\
$X \intersection (Y - Z) = (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$ (Conclusion)
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To derive our conclusion, we must first prove
\begin{center}
    If $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$, then $x \in (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$
\end{center}

and 
\begin{center}
    If $x \in (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$, then $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$.
\end{center}

To prove the former, let $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$.  By the definition of intersection, if $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$, then $x \in X$ and $x \in Y - Z$.  By the definition of set difference, if $x \in Y - Z$, then $x \in Y$, but $x \notin Z$.  If $x \in X$ and $x \in Y$, then $x \in X \intersection Y$.  If $x \in X \intersection Y$ and $x \notin Z$, then $x \notin X \intersection Z$.  Therefore, if $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$, then $x \in (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$.\\

To prove the latter, let $x \in (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$.  By set difference, if $x \in (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$, then $x \in (X \intersection Y)$ and $x \notin (X \intersection Z)$.  If $x \in (X \intersection Y)$, then, by intersection, $x \in X$ and $x \in Y$.  If $x \in X$ and $x \notin X \intersection Z$, then $X \notin Z$.  By the definition of set difference, since $x \in Y$ and $x \notin Z$, $x \in Y - Z$.  Finally, since $x \in X$ and $x \in Y - Z$, then $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$.  Therefore, if $x \in (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$, then $x \in X \intersection (Y - Z)$.\\

Since we proved both of these equations, it follows that

\begin{center}
    $X \intersection (Y - Z) = (X \intersection Y) - (X \intersection Z)$.
\end{center}
